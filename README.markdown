## About the app
BabelPicker is a simple color picker for Mac OS 10.5 and up. It was created because I needed a tool that could grab a color from the screen and make it into a UIColor or NSColor that I could use in XCode. 

## How it works
* Move the picker around. When the color is updated, it is automatically copied to your clipboard. Just go to your text editor and paste it.
* Use the arrow keys to move the picker around a pixel at a time.
* Click the picker to switch preview modes between full color and pixel preview.
* You can change the color format and other options from the menu.

### Color formats
* **RGB:** 46, 92, 33
* **Hex:** #2E5C21
* **UIColor:** [UIColor colorWithRed:0.44 green:0.53 blue:0.14 alpha:1.0]
* **NSColor:** [NSColor colorWithRed:0.44 green:0.53 blue:0.14 alpha:1.0]

## Known bugs
* The picker update rate is too slow
